1. Overall Fuel Efficiency: The average combined MPG for the dataset is about X MPG, varying across brands and years.
2. Engine Trends: Smaller engines with fewer cylinders are more common in recent years, indicating a trend towards efficiency.
3. Drivetrain Distribution: FWD dominates, with AWD vehicles showing lower fuel efficiency.
4. City vs. Highway Fuel Efficiency: Highway MPG is higher than city MPG on average, especially in SUVs and larger vehicles.
5. Fuel Efficiency and Engine Size: Larger engines are generally less efficient, but modern designs mitigate this.
6. Feature Importance: Drivetrain and fuel type are important factors affecting fuel efficiency.
7. Clustering Analysis: Three main clusters emerge based on MPG, with distinct differences in city and highway performance.
