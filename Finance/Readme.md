# Hi there, I'm Srijan 👋

### 🚀 Data Scientist | Quant Developer | Entrepreneur

I sit at the intersection of **High-Frequency Finance** and **Deep Learning**. My work focuses on building autonomous systems that can detect fraud, predict volatility, and value assets with superhuman precision.

Currently bridging the gap between academic research and production-grade AI pipelines.

## 🧠 Featured Portfolio

### 1. [The Detective: Anti-Money Laundering with Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/02_Financial_Crime_Graph)
**Goal:** Identify illicit Bitcoin transactions in a network of 200k+ nodes.
* **The Tech:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), PyTorch Geometric, NetworkX.
* **The "Alpha":** Modeled the *topology* of crime rather than just tabular features. Solved extreme class imbalance (0.1% illicit) to detect money laundering rings.

### 2. [The Quant: High-Frequency Volatility Prediction](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/01_Quantitative_Trading)
**Goal:** Forecast short-term volatility using Order Book (Tick-Level) data.
* **The Tech:** 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Parquet, PyTorch.
* **The "Alpha":** Engineered a "Tensor Factory" to convert jagged tick data into fixed-grid signals. Stabilized gradients using Z-Score Normalization on microstructure features.

### 3. [The Analyst: Financial Sentiment Signal](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/03_Sentiment_LLM)
**Goal:** Generate alpha signals from unstructured financial news headlines.
* **The Tech:** Hugging Face Transformers, FinBERT, NLP.
* **The "Alpha":** Built an inference pipeline that digests Analyst Ratings and outputs a continuous "Bullish/Bearish" confidence score, filtering out market noise.

### 4. [The Valuator: Real Estate Arbitrage Engine](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/04_Real_Estate_Pricing)
**Goal:** Predict pricing errors (Zestimates) to identify undervalued assets.
* **The Tech:** Stacking Regressor (LightGBM + XGBoost + Linear Meta-Learner).
* **The "Alpha":** Reduced memory footprint by 60% via type downcasting. Engineered "Relative Value" features (e.g., Price vs. Neighborhood Avg) to beat the statistical baseline by ~1%.

## 📈 Philosophy
> "In God we trust. All others must bring data." — *W. Edwards Deming*

I believe the future of finance belongs to those who can treat **Market Microstructure**, **Language**, and **Graphs** as a single unified dataset.
