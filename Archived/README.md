# Archived Projects

This directory contains experimental notebooks, incomplete projects, and tutorials that are kept for reference but not part of the main portfolio.

## Contents

### Calculator_GUI.ipynb
Tkinter-based calculator application (not data science related).

### Credit_Card_Untitled.ipynb
Incomplete credit card analysis.

### Laptop_Data_Untitled.ipynb
Unfinished laptop purchase analysis.

### Web_Scraping_Tutorial.ipynb

### Manual_Chatbot.ipynb

## Purpose

These notebooks are archived because they:
- Are incomplete or experimental
- Lack clear business value or insights
- Are not representative of best practices
- Serve as learning exercises rather than portfolio pieces

**Note:** These files are kept for historical reference and learning purposes but should not be considered production-ready or portfolio-quality work.
